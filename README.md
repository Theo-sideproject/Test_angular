# Little Angular App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.3.
This is a simple Angular app that displays a list of items and allows the user to add new items to the list. The app uses a service to manage the list of items and the list of items is displayed in a table. The user can add new items to the list by entering the item name and clicking the "Add Item" button. The app also includes a button that allows the user to clear the list of items.

## Development server
